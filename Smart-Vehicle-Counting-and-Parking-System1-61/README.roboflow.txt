The dataset includes 4168 images.
Car are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 420x420 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -30 and +30 degrees
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.75 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
